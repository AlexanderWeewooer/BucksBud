# üè¶ BucksBud üíµ
Budgeting app created to mimic the functioning of YNAB but with some aspects I wanted to improve. With this project I'm trying to learn the React(JS) Framework.

I feel like YNAB, the app I personally use, is way too expensive for such simple functions it provides.
(This project runs on a free domain "[to update]". The account to access to see it is: [to update])
